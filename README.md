# TreePeople

The tree_people gem allows users to navigate through the next 20 events that TreePeople is having. Users can view events by location, category (or type of event), the day of the week the event is being held on, the time of day the event starts (morning, afternoon, or evening), or the user can view all of the next 20 events being held by TreePeople.

Users can then select a specific event to get detailed information on it, including a brief description and how many spots are still available, as well as the URL to sign up.

## Installation
